# DESCRIPTION
* Tasktree is a to-do app that arranges tasks in a tree structure, written entirely in C.
* It is currently very WIP, so **expect frequent breaking changes**.

# BASIC USAGE
* Tasks are currently passed as a path like so: *"task-name1/task-name2/..."*
* Use *"new [parent task]"* to make a new task. If no parent task is given, it will make a root task.
* Use *"remove [task]"* to remove it.
* Use *"list"* to list tasks.

# GOALS
- [ ] Windows support
- [ ] Store creation time
- [ ] Set deadlines
- [ ] Make a GUI, probably using GTK
- [ ] Color-code tasks
